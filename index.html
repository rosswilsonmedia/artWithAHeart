				<h3>The Art With A Heart Story</h3>
					<p>Founder and art teacher Carol Conrad created Art With a Heart in <strong>2002</strong> to provide hands-on visual art experiences that educate, inspire, and give hope to children. By <strong>2005</strong>, Art With a Heart started with two summer camps and quickly grew. Within 3 years, AWaH was running programming year-round and adding after school programs during the school year. Around the same time, AWaH opened its first studio and began offering Saturday classes which grew into the Honors programs that serves the most artistically interested students. AWaH launched a kindergarten program in <strong>2007</strong> in response to the state’s decision to fund all-day kindergarten. In <strong>2009</strong>, Carol Conrad retired, placing the organization in the hands of the Board of Trustees and a new Executive Director.</p>

				<h3>Setting the Standard for Art</h3>
					<p>Art With a Heart offers a variety of art programs for children who want to learn and explore through art instruction and education in urban neighborhoods throughout Indianapolis. We offer several studio programs for students second through twelfth grade, as well as a unique in-school professional development program that helps classroom teachers administer an integrated arts curriculum to early childhood classrooms.  During the summer months, we provide a full-day, immersive art camp experience. Student art galleries are held at the conclusion of each programming session to celebrate their successes and engage parents and community members.</p>
				<h3>Our Program Offerings</h3>
					<p>Many children who come to Art With a Heart have had little exposure to the arts; some only having experience with basic drawing materials.  By giving these students the opportunity to create with high quality art materials, we expose them to more than one way of looking at and creating art.  Art With a Heart is dedicated to introducing children to the joy that comes from creating art in a safe, secure and enriching environment.</p>
				<h3>Our Core Values</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Quality art starts with quality materials</li>
						<li>Low student/teacher ratios (15:1), which allow us to give more individual attention</li>
						<li>The emotional well-being of our students is of utmost importance</li>
						<li>Student safety is paramount</li>
						<li>The joy of the creative process is always to be encouraged</li>
						<li>Students should be held to high expectations in order to do their best work</li>
						<li>State standards for education should and will be incorporated into lesson plans</li>
						<li>Students can/will be challenged to learn creativity and applying problem-solving skills</li>
						<li>Artistic skill/technique is first demonstrated, then practiced, reviewed and tested</li>
						<li>Students can/should be taught leadership development, team building and cooperation skills</li>
						<li>Students can/should be taught to focus and follow through on projects to completion</li>
					</ul>

						<h3>Meet The Instructor: Mrs. Green</h3>
							<img src="images/staff/laura.jpg" alt="Laura Teaching a Student">
							<p>I have loved art ever since I can remember. As an adult, I continue to explore and create while sharing my passion with students through thoughtful and enthusiastic instruction. I graduated from Taylor University in 2004 and earned my master of education degree from Indiana Wesleyan in 2009. The first seven years of my career I spent teaching in elementary and middle schools in Tennessee and Indiana. In 2011, I left the public school system to explore opportunities to teach art that would allow me to stay at home with my three children. It’s been a wonderful journey and I am thrilled to be partnering with Art With a Heart to serve the needs of homeschool students in Indianapolis!</p>

					<h3>2019-2020 Classes</h3>
						<p>Registration is currently closed. If you have questions, please email <a href="mailto:AWAH@artwithaheart.us">AWAH@artwithaheart.us</a> with questions</p>
					<h3>The Elements of Art</h3>
						<p>At the AWaH Homeschool program, students receive excellent art instruction, empowering young artists to grow in their artistic abilities, while making new friends, and having lots of fun! Students will be exposed to a broad variety of art materials and processes. Our focus for the 2019-2020 school year is: <strong>The Elements of Art.</strong> We'll be exploring the fundamental 'ingredients' of ART (Line, Shape, Color, Value, Texture, and Form) with an all-star lineup of projects that expose these young artists to a wide range of materials and processes. Students receive excellent art instruction each and every week while making new friends, growing in their artistic abilities, and having a lot of fun!</p>
